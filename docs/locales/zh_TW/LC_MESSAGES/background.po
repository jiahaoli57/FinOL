"Early online portfolio selection (OLPS) methods relied on a priori "
"assumptions about market dynamics and mathematical optimization. With "
"increased computing power and data, data-driven OLPS methods that "
"directly learn from data have gained attention."

"While various data-driven OLPS methods have shown promise, evaluating and"
" comparing them remains challenging. Without standardized datasets and "

"world environments, hindering progress in this field."

"Researchers often default to assuming newer methods are superior, but "
"this is irresponsible without consistent test conditions. Financial time "
"series are highly non-stationary, so the same method can exhibit "
"drastically different performance on different datasets."

"In the context of online portfolio selection, we analyze a financial "
"market consisting :math:`m` assets observed during a specified time "
"horizon comprising :math:`n` discrete trading periods (the term "
"\"periods\" is defined flexibly). At the end of the :math:`t`-th trading "
"period, we use a :math:`m`-dimensional non-negative price relatives "
"vector :math:`\\mathbf{x}_t=(x_{t,1},\\ldots,x_{t,m}) \\in "
"\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{m}` to represent the performance of the :math:`m` "
"assets, where each element :math:`x_{t,i}` equals the close price of "
"asset :math:`i` on the :math:`t`-th trading period divided by the close "
"price of asset :math:`i` on the :math:`(t-1)`-th trading period, i.e., "

"beginning of the :math:`t`-th trading period. A portfolio clearly needs "
